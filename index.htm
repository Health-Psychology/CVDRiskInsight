            <p>Knowing to what extent patients have an accurate perception of their risk, and also their attitude towards their own ability to influence their risk and beliefs about the effectiveness of lifestyle change,
            can provide a context for understanding and empowering the patient.</p>
            <p>This tool contains four questions to support clinicians in assessing accuracy of CVD risk perception and efficacy beliefs in patients to enhance shared decision making.</p>
